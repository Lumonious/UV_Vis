# UV-Visible Spectroscopy in Computational Chemistry

This repository contains the computational results and analysis of UV-Visible spectra for a series of conjugated cyclic dienes using quantum chemical methods.



# Project Overview
This project focuses on the computational determination of UV-Vis absorption spectra for the following molecules:

1,3-Cyclopentadiene

1,3-Cyclohexadiene

1,3-Cycloheptadiene

1,3-Cyclooctadiene

Each compound was optimized and subjected to UV-Vis calculations using quantum chemical methods, with water as the solvent.

# Methodology
# Geometry Optimization
Performed using [Insert Software and Method – e.g., Gaussian with B3LYP/6-31G(d)].

# UV-Vis Spectrum Calculation
Carried out in water solution to simulate realistic solvent effects.

# Results

Each compound’s UV-Vis spectrum is presented and compared with available literature values. The spectral shifts observed with increasing ring size offer insights into conjugation and electronic transitions.

# References

A full list of references used for comparison and methodology validation is available in the final slide of the presentation.

# Files
HW5_NurefşanNY.pptx: Presentation file including all spectra and comparison data.

# Objectives
Apply computational chemistry tools to predict electronic transitions.

Understand the cerrelation between structure and UV-Vis spectral behavior.

Compare computational data with experimental/literature values for validation.
